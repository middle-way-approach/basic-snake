![Basic Snake](![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/middle-way-approach/basic-snake/master/snake.png) 

This is a Snake game written in Googles [web-based BASIC interpreter](https://github.com/google/wwwbasic). Control the snake with WASD.

I'm currently looking for contributors to make this a PR for the examples of the wwwbasic repo. Feel free to grab an [issue] and 
have a look at the [project](https://github.com/middle-way-approach/basic-snake/projects/1). If you find more issues please file them.
